The C++ Implementation
The code in predict_6hours.cpp is a direct port of the Python script with the same functionality:

It loads the TFLite model (wifi_app_predictor.tflite)
It loads the application encoding mappings from application_encoding.json
It generates timestamps at 30-minute intervals for the next 6 hours
For each timestamp, it makes multiple predictions with slight variations
It weights predictions based on confidence scores
It counts frequencies and returns the top 5 most common application types

How to Use It
You can run the C++ program with a timestamp as an argument:
bash./predict_6hours 1744574220
Or without arguments to use the current time:
bash./predict_6hours
Building the Code
I've provided two additional files to help with building the code:

CMakeLists.txt - For building with CMake
Building instructions - A guide for installing dependencies and building on different systems

Dependencies
The code needs:

TensorFlow Lite C++ library
JsonCpp library (for parsing the application encoding file)
C++11 or later compiler

Configuring the Confidence Threshold
The confidence threshold is set on line 279 in the C++ code:
cppif (confidence > 0.1) {  // 10% confidence threshold
You can change 0.1 to a lower value (like 0.05) to include more predictions with lower confidence, or a higher value (like 0.2) to be more selective.
For Router Deployment
To deploy this on a router:

Cross-compile the code for your router's architecture
Copy the executable, the TFLite model file, and the encoding JSON to the router
Make the executable runnable (chmod +x predict_6hours)
Run it with a timestamp argument

The build instructions document provides more details about building for embedded systems and OpenWrt routers.
